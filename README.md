# kat-numpad-mouse-daemon
Kat is a lightweight daemon written in C that turns your full numpad into a mouse input device on Linux systems. It supports mouse movement, clicks, scrolling, autoscrolling, and configurable jumps/margins. The daemon runs in the background as a systemd user service and requires root privileges for input simulation.
